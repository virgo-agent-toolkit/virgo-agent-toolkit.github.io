## What is an agent?

We think of an agent as a small program responsible for interfacing to some resource on behalf of a user or application. We call the corresponding program (or library) responsible for interfacing to the agent on behalf of the application an 'endpoint'.

Often this agent is running on a remote host and the endpoint is running locally to the service which is using it.

## How can I make an agent?

An agent can be this simple:

{% highlight lua %}
local agent = require('virgo').agent
 
# the updates modules adds update-specific behavior
local updates = require('updates')
  
# provides the ability to configure from the filesystem
local file_config = require('file_config')
 
return agent([updates, file_config])
{% endhighlight %}

Here's an agent and endpoint in nodejs:

{% highlight javascript %}
var virgo = require('..');

var agent = virgo.agent;
var endpoint = virgo.endpoint;
var heartbeats = virgo.heartbeats;

endpoint([heartbeats(function(hb) {
  process.stdout.write('received hb\n');
  process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify(hb, 0, 2) + '\n');
})]).run();

agent([heartbeats()]).run();
{% endhighlight %}

## So why is making agents hard?

- Security is hard and very important
- Networks are unreliable
- Remote machines are often behind firewalls or NAT
- Writing binaries for every platform is hard
- Building packages for all operating systems is hard, ditto build infrastructure and installers
- Once agents are installed on remote machines operated by others, keeping those agents up-to-date is hard
- Writing software which uses memory, CPU, and network efficiently is hard (especially with popular dynamic languages)
- Writing perfectly correct and reliable code is hard
- Integrating with crash-capturing services such as Google's Breakpad is a hassle

## Why a project for agents generally?

Once and for all, let's solve the problems everyone encounters whenever they build an agent. Come build your agent with us!

## Virgo Base Agent

The [Virgo base agent](https://github.com/virgo-agent-toolkit/virgo-base-agent) is written in C with an embedded [Luvit](http://luvit.io/) runtime.

- Ease of extension with application-specific behaviors via a common interface
- An extensible, versioned protocol on a redundant, secure connection to at least one controller endpoint
- Packages, build infrastructure, installers, and related goodies for many platforms
- Auto-updating controlled from the endpoint
- Crash capturing and reporting with Google's Breakpad

Many of these features can be discarded. The [virgo-example-agent](https://github.com/virgo-agent-toolkit/virgo-example-agent) shows the absolute smallest Virgo agent.

## Virgo libraries

- [Virgo.js](https://github.com/virgo-agent-toolkit/virgo.js)
- [go-agent-endpoint](https://github.com/virgo-agent-toolkit/go-agent-endpoint)

## Protocol

An open, versioned, easy-to-implement protocol between endpoints and agents enables interoperability. The Virgo protocol consists of messages which are newline-delimited json objects (like [json-rpc](http://json-rpc.org/)).
